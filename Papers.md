Paper explaining PMD patterns, stating that C-T mutations occur at the 5' overhanging fragment ends, with 3' G-A mutations being a product of the same concept on the reverse strand:

This other paper talks a bit about fragmentation but also clarifies that the reason why 3' overhangs are not represented is because the library prep involves cleaving these and filling in the 5' overhangs:

It is unclear from these early papers the extent to which cross linking affects aDNA. Preservates (eg formaldehyde) may induce them. DNA polymerase stalls at crosslinks, resulting in shorter read sizes.
