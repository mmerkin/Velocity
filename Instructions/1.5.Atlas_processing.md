# Initial processing with Atlas

## Installation

Atlas is difficult to install on the CGR cluster due to the presence of multiple versions of some of its dependencies, so it doesn't know which versions to use. Therefore, I created a conda environment
with new versions of these packages to use, which can be found here.

Afterwards, one needs to follow the instructions on the Atlas wiki page for installation, which are also given here:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://bitbucket.org/WegmannLab/atlas.git
cd atlas
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

For ease of use, the command to run atlas can be set as in alias:
```
cd # Return to home directory
nano .bash_aliases
alias atlas='~/apps/atlas/build/atlas'
```
If no aliases have been set before, the if statement in the .bashrc file relating bash_aliases needs to be uncommented out. Note that this may not work in shell scripts, so it is better to provide
the full command


## Processing script

Initial processing of the alignment files using Atlas can be performed with the script Atlas_prep.sh, replacing the relevant variables as below:

```bash
datapath=~/velocity/Aphantopus_hyperantus/modc_realign
output=~/velocity/Aphantopus_hyperantus/modc_final
readGroup=E3modc
seqCycles=151

ATLAS=~/apps/atlas/build/atlas
```

So far, all of the modern samples appear to have been sequenced with 151 cycles, whilst the museum samples used 76. However, these can be double checked by picking a representative sample and running:

```bash
atlas BAMDiagnostics --splitMergeInput --bam $INPUT.bam
cat $INPUT_splitMergeInput.txt
```
