# Atlas error recalibration

Since the museum samples are subject to post-mortem damage (PMD), they are treated separately from the modern samples. Additionally, this command takes a long time to run, so GNU parallel is used to run it
on multiple samples at the same time rather than the for loops that run one after another. However, this can use a lot of memory, so the parameter --memfree is used to prevent any additional samples from being run when there is less than a specified amount of memory available; if there is less than that value/2 memory left, the most recent task to run will be killed, so retries are set to allow any killed processes to run again when memory becomes available. 

## Museum samples
```bash
parallel -j 10 --memfree 400G --retries 10 \
atlas estimateErrors \
--fasta $REF \
--minDeltaLL 0.1 \
--bam {} ::: *.bam
```

## Modern samples
```bash
parallel -j 5 --memfree 400G --retries 10 \
atlas estimateErrors \
--fasta $REF \
--NPsi 0 \
--minDeltaLL 0.1 \
--bam {} ::: *.bam
```

Notice that the command for modern samples has an additional setting of '--NPsi 0' to turn off the PMD estimation and fewer jobs running at once as the higher coverage modern samples use much more memory. A javascript object notation file will then be produced, ending in _RGInfo.json, containing all of the recalibration parameters; this file should be supplied as an input for any downstream steps.

## Backup recalibration parameter files

Many of the processes in atlas generate one of these _RGInfo.json files, which runs the risk of overwriting the recalibration parameter files if they are not supplied first, meaning that estimateErrors must be run again. To avoid this, it is recommened to backup all recalibration parameter files before running any other atlas commands.

```bash
cp modc_final/*/*_RGInfo.json modc_recal_backup
```
