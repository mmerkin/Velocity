# Atlas error recalibration

Since the museum samples are subject to post-mortem damage (PMD), they are treated separately from the modern samples. Additionally, this command takes a long time to run, so GNU parallel is used to run it
on multiple samples at the same time rather than the for loops that run one after another. As such, the conda environment parallel was used.

## Museum samples
```bash
parallel -j 8 ~/apps/atlas/build/atlas estimateErrors \
--fasta $REF \
--minDeltaLL 0.1 \
--bam {} ::: *.bam
```

## Modern samples
```bash
parallel -j 8 ~/apps/atlas/build/atlas estimateErrors \
--fasta $REF \
--NPsi 0 \
--minDeltaLL 0.1 \
--bam {} ::: *.bam
```

Notice that the command for modern samples has an additional setting of '--NPsi 0' to turn off the PMD estimation.
