Look how sample size affects theta


This is what it looks like for modern vs museum raw ringlet samples:

Downsampling 100 times results in a much higher theta

Raw downsampled modern samples still have a lower theta than the museum samples:

After recalibration, museum has a much lower theta, although the iqr is higher
