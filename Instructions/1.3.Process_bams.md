# Process bam files

Each individual should have sorted bam files, which need to undergo initial filtering using one of two scripts:

### Progress bar

[Process_bams_progress_bar.sh](https://github.com/mmerkin/Velocity/blob/main/scripts/Process_bams_progress_bar.sh) carries out the filtering by displaying a progress bar for each step, 
stopping if there are any errors

### Log file

[Process_bams_log_file.sh](https://github.com/mmerkin/Velocity/blob/main/scripts/Process_bams_log_file.sh) instead outputs a log file for any samples that fail, 
continuing with the next sample if there are any errors. This script is very useful in debugging to see if there is a common trend between samples that do and do not fail.

## Inputs

Before running either script, the variables at the top must be replaced. Here is an example for the Ringlet modern core samples.

unplaced=CADCXM02000
mtDNA=PP432637


```bash
datapath=~/velocity/Aphantopus_hyperantus/modc_mapping  # Path to directory contaiing bam files to be filtered
output=~/velocity/Aphantopus_hyperantus/modc_processing # Path to directory to output filtered bams
threads=12  # Number of threads to use
remove_temp=true  # Set as false to keep all of the temporary bams produced during the filtering process

add_RG=true  # Set to false if you do not need to add read group information.
# If addRG is false, assign random values to the below variables as these will not be used
PICARD=~/apps/picard/build/libs/picard.jar  # Path to picard executable file
RGID=E3modc  # ID for read group (from spreadsheet)
RGLB=mod03  # Read Group library (from spreadsheet)

logfile=Ah_modc_bamprep.log # The log file script also requires a log file name
```
